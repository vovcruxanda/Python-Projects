This Tic Tac Toe game is a web-based version where a player plays against a computer.

First, I setuped my environment by instaling Flask from cmd with command: `pip install flask`. I have a very simple backend logic in app.py, where python handle game state and serve HTML. Also, in game_logic.py I implemented the game logic. Finally, HTML and CSS are used to make a beutiful interface with neon style.
